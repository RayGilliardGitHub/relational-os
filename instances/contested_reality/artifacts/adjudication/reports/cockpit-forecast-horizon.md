# §7L horizon-wide do-nothing band + Q9 capacity-attention — engine-native render (Sprint 25)
generated 2026-09-01T05:45:50Z  |  `adjudication_engine._forecast_closure`/`cockpit_s7l`  |  recorded `metric://` series + recorded point-`variance` values + the recorded `band_variance` source -> the SAME recorded sigma applied to EVERY projection period (band_periods) + the record-wide horizon worst case (band_horizon = min low / max high) + a Q9 capacity-attention flag (horizon range vs the recorded threshold; references any recorded capacity without inventing one). Additive; default orgs byte-identical to Sprint 23/24 except the new band_periods/band_horizon/band_capacity_attention keys  |  SPEC v0.22, 49 $defs, URI cap

The do-nothing expected-impact now prices the recorded SPREAD ACROSS THE WHOLE HORIZON, not just the single worst point: the same recorded sigma (± a recorded point variance magnitude) is applied to EVERY projected value -> a per-period low/high, and the record-wide min-low / max-high (band_horizon) is the whole-horizon worst case AS DATA. Q9 carries a capacity-attention flag: whether that horizon range signals the recorded threshold; it references any RECORDED capacity but never fabricates a number. This is still a recorded-data spread, NOT a probability/confidence interval, never the wall-clock.

## §16 verdict

**The do-nothing price + Q9 capacity-attention now carry the recorded whole-horizon worst case as data where it exists.** The same recorded sigma (one recorded point |variance| magnitude, per the recorded `band_variance` source) is applied to EVERY projection period -> `band_periods` (per-period low/high) + `band_horizon` (record-wide min-low/max-high), which can WIDEN beyond the single-worst point's band when an earlier period at +σ exceeds the worst point's own band — still a pure function of recorded values + the recorded sigma, not a new model. Q9's `band_capacity_attention` flag derives from the horizon range vs the recorded threshold and references any RECORDED capacity without inventing one; a no-variance / no-data org carries none of the new keys (byte-identical). The Q8 recommendation is UNCHANGED: the band prices attention + do-nothing; it never overrules the §6-floor-gated machine-eligible best. **Still not derivable:** an org that records no point variances cannot be priced as a band (correct); a capacity-attention NUMBER is never fabricated (the engine only flags/reasons); and this remains a recorded-spread range, NOT a probabilistic confidence interval (a stochastic/adaptive forecast stays out of the deterministic ~$0 stance).

_Additive; frozen ontology, SPEC v0.22, 49 $defs. Horizon-wide band + Q9 capacity-attention price the recorded whole-horizon spread as data; they never overrule the §6 human or the floor-gated recommendation._
