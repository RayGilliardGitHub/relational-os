# §7L recorded-variance band → do-nothing expected-impact — engine-native render (Sprint 23)
generated 2026-09-01T05:39:58Z  |  `adjudication_engine.cockpit_s7l`/`render_cockpit_s7l`  |  recorded `metric://` series + recorded last-point `variance` (magnitude σ) -> Q8/trade-off do-nothing priced as a projected BAND (worst ± σ) where the data exists; a no-variance series keeps the Sprint-22 single-point output byte-identical  |  SPEC v0.22, 49 $defs, URI cap

The do-nothing expected-impact now prices the RECORDED SPREAD, not just the single point: when the org's recorded `metric://` series carries a numeric `variance` on its last point, the closure reports a projected band low…high = worst ± |recorded variance| and whether the WORST side of the band crosses the recorded threshold. This is a recorded-data spread — it bounds the deterministic projection by the recorded historical variance — NOT a probability/confidence interval and never the wall-clock.

## §16 verdict

**The do-nothing expected-impact now prices the recorded spread as data WHERE it exists.** For any org that records a realized-vs-expected `metric://` series whose last point carries a numeric `variance`, the Q8/trade-off do-nothing baseline is priced as a projected band — worst (per the recorded `direction`) ± the recorded variance as a magnitude — reported as low…high, the recorded `expected` last value surfaced as the anchor, and whether the worst side crosses the threshold made explicit on the Q3 attention `why` and the do-nothing summary. It is deterministic and data-only: worst, the recorded variance, and the threshold are the only inputs to low/high and crosses; never the wall-clock, never an invented variance. A series with no recorded variance — or a no-data org — keeps the Sprint-22 single-point/fallback behavior BYTE-IDENTICAL. The Q8 recommendation is UNCHANGED: the band prices attention and the do-nothing baseline, it never overrules the §6-floor-gated machine-eligible best. What is still not derivable: a series that does NOT record a variance cannot be made to produce a band (the engine reports the recorded reality, it does not manufacture a spread), and this is a recorded spread, NOT a probabilistic confidence interval from a model — a stochastic/adaptive forecast remains out of scope of the honest, deterministic, ~$0 stance.

_Additive; frozen ontology, SPEC v0.22, 49 $defs. The band prices the recorded do-nothing spread; it never overrules the §6 human or the floor-gated recommendation._
